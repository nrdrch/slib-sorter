###### *for now only meant to run on Windows10

2. Move all your files into the 'To Be Sorted' directory
3. Run the same command again and wait for the process to be completed 
4. Inspect the newly created Sample Library located under 'Documents\Sample Library' folder.


### Suggestions
- Create a function in - or imported into your $PROFILE for easier Execution.

```
# $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
# example function 
# Change the name to your prefered alias for easier execution.
function sorter {
    python3 $HOME\Documents\slib-sorter\src\slib-sorter.py
}
```

### Future additions
- [ ] Continue to work on the sorting itself 
- [ ] Apply somewhat simple AI to further boost accuracy, including sorting not based on names but sound.
